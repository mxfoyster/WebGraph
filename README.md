# WebGraph
A simple graphics calculator app based on JavaScript and graph.js 


## A small start

This will be a simple background project inspired by the likes of [https://www.desmos.com/calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).

For now, we can just set the range and grid size / resolution of the x axis and choose between two pre-defined functions (sin and x^2). It's something to get us started.

Keep your eyes on this, I've only just started!
