# WebGraph
A simple graphics calculator app based on JavaScript and graph.js 


## A small start

This will be a simple background project inspired by the likes of [https://www.desmos.com/calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).

For now, we can just set the range and grid size / resolution of the x axis and choose between two pre-defined functions (sin and x^2). 

Most recent addition is a colour opicker for the graph line and now the graph automatically updates when we change ANY value. The css has been tweaked slightly to make things a little tidier.

## A bit more

We now have SINE, COSINE and TANGENT along with X^2, X^3 and 1/X as predefined functions (press and go graphs)

Further to that, we have the choice of 2:1, 1:1 and 1:2 aspect ratio for the chart itself. Note: Using 1:2 aspect ratio seems to be a bit buggy. That's setting it to 0.5 within Chart.js and I don't think they had that in mind somehow but for the most part it works.

The next step could be a lot more complicated as I need an expression builder. Thinking caps on!!
